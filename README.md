# Beyond Revenue: A SQL Deep Dive into Profit Leakage

## üìä Project Overview

**Beyond Revenue** is an advanced SQL-powered data analytics solution designed to identify and quantify profit leakage in a mid-size omnichannel retail company. Despite growing revenue, particularly through online channels, the company faces stagnating or declining profit margins. This project consolidates disparate data sources into a unified star schema data mart, delivers actionable insights through sophisticated SQL queries, and provides dashboard-ready views to empower data-driven decision-making.

The project focuses on three key areas of profit erosion:
- **High Product Returns**: Impacting gross margins across product categories and channels.
- **Inefficient Marketing Spend**: Low ROI from marketing campaigns.
- **Operational Inefficiencies**: High costs in inventory and returns processing.

## üéØ Business Impact
By implementing this analytics framework, the company can:
- **Pinpoint Profit Leaks**: Identify specific products, channels, or customer segments driving losses.
- **Optimize Marketing Budgets**: Focus on high-ROI campaigns and customer segments.
- **Reduce Return Rates**: Address problematic products or customer behaviors.
- **Enhance Operational Efficiency**: Streamline inventory and returns processing.
- **Increase Net Profit Margins**: Ensure sustainable growth through data-driven strategies.

## üîç Project Objective
To uncover the hidden causes of **profit erosion** in a mid-sized retail operation by using advanced SQL queries to analyze:
- Customer behavior
- Return trends
- Campaign inefficiencies
- Operational costs
- Inventory mismatches

## üß† Key Business Questions
1. Who are our most valuable customers (lifetime value)?
2. How many customers are at risk of churn?
3. Which campaigns wasted marketing dollars?
4. What products are returned most frequently?
5. Where is inventory not matching demand?
6. Which regions and store types drive the most profit?
7. How does shipping delay affect returns?
8. Does shipping delay increase return likelihood?
9. Which products are facing shipping delays, and could they contribute to higher returns or churn?
10. Which popular products are generating weak returns per unit sold?

## üõ†Ô∏è Deliverables

- **Unified Star Schema Data Mart**: Fact and dimension tables for sales, returns, marketing, and operational data.
- **Advanced SQL Queries**: 9+ queries addressing critical business questions (e.g., return rates, campaign ROI, cost analysis).
- **Stored Procedures**: Automate data aggregation, alerts for high return rates, and error logging.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Indexing and materialized views for efficient query execution.
- **Dashboard-Ready Views**: SQL views tailored for BI tools like Tableau or Power BI.
- **Documented Codebase**: Fully commented SQL scripts hosted on GitHub for transparency and collaboration.
