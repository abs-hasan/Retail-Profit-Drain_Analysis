# Beyond Revenue: A SQL Deep Dive into Profit Leakage

---

## üìä Project Overview

**Beyond Revenue** is an advanced SQL-powered data analytics solution designed to identify and quantify profit leakage in a mid-size omnichannel retail company. Despite growing revenue, particularly through online channels, the company faces stagnating or declining profit margins. This project consolidates disparate data sources into a unified star schema data mart, delivers actionable insights through sophisticated SQL queries, and provides dashboard-ready views to empower data-driven decision-making.

The project focuses on three key areas of profit erosion:
- **High Product Returns**: Impacting gross margins across product categories and channels.
- **Inefficient Marketing Spend**: Low ROI from marketing campaigns.
- **Operational Inefficiencies**: High costs in inventory and returns processing.
